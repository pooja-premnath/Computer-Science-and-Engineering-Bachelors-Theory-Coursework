# Computer Science and Engineering - Bachelor's Theory Coursework

These are the courses I completed during my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering with Honors in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Each semester, I would write notes to help myself understand the material better, and so that I wouldn't stare at my laptop screen too much.  
Now that I have finished my undergraduate degree, I thought of putting them together here in case they might be helpful to others.  

I have notes for most subjects, but there are a few where I put in some extra effort - either because:  
- The subject was difficult and needed more focus, or  
- I found the subject interesting and wanted to study it more carefully.

The subjects where I ended up making especially detailed notes are:

1. **Digital Principles and System Design** (especially Synchronous and Asynchronous System Design, and Programmable Logic)
2. **Database Management Systems** (particularly RDBMS Design and Transaction Processing)
3. **Microprocessors, Microcontrollers, and Interfacing** (this was a tough class- tried to become proficient in 8086 programming, so lots of examples there)
4. **Image Processing and Analysis** (the textbook was too fat to learn from, also added lots of practice problems)
5. **Mathematics for Machine Learning - Honors**  (I really loved this class!)
6. **Theory of Computation** (had to practice a lot of problems, because I found the subject really hard)
7. **Internet Programming** (lots of examples on Servlets, AJAX, React, and full-stack integration in Units 3, 4 and 5)
8. **Distributed Systems** (Liked the class and the intuitive nature of the algorithms- lots of practice examples too!)

Wherever possible, I have also linked related lab programs or project repositories for each subject.
